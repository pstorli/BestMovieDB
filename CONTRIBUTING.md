I would rather people not contribute to this project, except me.

This project was specifically designed to help other android kotlin

developers understand and touch a real working project that uses the following latest tech:

Android Studio, UI/UIX, Kotlin, Coroutines, Java, Fragments, MVVM, Jetpack, RecyclerView, NavController,

Room, SQLite, JSON, Retrofit, Rest, OKhttp, Glide, Moshi, Gradle, Ant, Junit, SQL, Xml, BDD, TDD, Git, Junit and Expresso 

I need to control who contributes because another goal of this project was to keep things as simple as possible,

that's why the UI could use some more polish, perhaps things could be changed here and there, but this is a sample

of the correct way to architect a project, so enjoy.
